**ATLAS - A Streamlit Web App** 

Welcome to ATLAS, a Streamlit web app designed to enhance your productivity and organization throughout the day.

ATLAS is a multi-functional tool that serves as an alarm, daily zodiac forecast, weather update, and reminder creator all in one place.

**Installation** 

To use ATLAS, follow these simple steps:

Download all files in the ATLAS repository.

Install playsound, specifically the updated version 'PyObjC', by running pip install playsound.

Install streamlit-option-menu by running pip install streamlit-option-menu.

Install Streamlit by running pip install streamlit.

Install requests by running pip install requests.

Install request-file by running pip install request-file.

Install pyobjc-core by running pip install pyobjc-core.

Install pyparser by running pip install pyparser.

Install beautifulsoup4 by running pip install beautifulsoup4.

Install DateTime by running pip install DateTime.

Install Pillow by running pip install Pillow.

Note that all sounds and images should be placed under a folder called "alarm_sounds" and "zodiac_images", respectively. The main demo file is programmed to read and extract these files from folders under this name. Doing this before running the web app will ensure a smooth installation and a clean download of information.

**Usage**
To start using ATLAS, run the main demo file by running streamlit run demo.py in your terminal. This will start the Streamlit server and open ATLAS in your default web browser.
