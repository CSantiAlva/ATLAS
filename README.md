\textbf{ATLAS - A Streamlit Web App}

Welcome to ATLAS, a Streamlit web app designed to enhance your productivity and organization throughout the day.

ATLAS is a multi-functional tool that serves as an alarm, daily zodiac forecast, weather update, and reminder creator all in one place.

\textbf{Installation}

To use ATLAS, follow these simple steps:

Download all files in the ATLAS repository.

Install playsound, specifically the updated version 'PyObjC', by running \texttt{pip install playsound}.

Install streamlit-option-menu by running \texttt{pip install streamlit-option-menu}.

Install Streamlit by running \texttt{pip install streamlit}.

Install requests by running \texttt{pip install requests}.

Install request-file by running \texttt{pip install request-file}.

Install pyobjc-core by running \texttt{pip install pyobjc-core}.

Install pyparser by running \texttt{pip install pyparser}.

Install beautifulsoup4 by running \texttt{pip install beautifulsoup4}.

Install DateTime by running \texttt{pip install DateTime}.

Install Pillow by running \texttt{pip install Pillow}.

Note that all sounds and images should be placed under a folder called "alarm_sounds" and "zodiac_images", respectively. The main demo file is programmed to read and extract these files from folders under this name. Doing this before running the web app will ensure a smooth installation and a clean download of information.

\textbf{Usage}

To start using ATLAS, run the main demo file by running \texttt{streamlit run demo.py} in your terminal. This will start the Streamlit server and open ATLAS in your default web browser.
